5	Pathogenic	Dec 30, 2019	Variant summary: FOXRED1 c.694C>T (p.Gln232X) results in a premature termination codon, predicted to cause a truncation of the encoded protein or absence of the protein due to nonsense mediated decay, which are commonly known mechanisms for disease. At least one publication reports experimental evidence that this variant affects mRNA splicing as evidenced by analysis of patient cDNA showing occasional skipping of exon 6, resulting in a transcript predicted to lack 40 internal residues (Calvo_2010). The variant allele was found at a frequency of 1.2e-05 in 251184 control chromosomes. c.694C>T has been reported in the literature in at-least one individual affected with Leigh syndrome (example, Calvo_2010). At least one publication reports experimental evidence evaluating an impact on protein function. The most pronounced variant effect results in defects in human mitochondrial complex I biogenesis (Formosa_2015). One clinical diagnostic laboratory has submitted clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014 without evidence for independent evaluation and classified the variant as pathogenic. Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as pathogenic.

5	Pathogenic	Dec 07, 2017	The Q232X variant in the FOXRED1 gene has been reported previously in Leigh syndrome, in an affected individual who was compound heterozygous for the Q232X variant and another FOXRED1 variant (Calvo et al., 2010). This variant is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function either through protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The Q232X variant is not observed at a significant frequency in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). We interpret Q232X as a pathogenic variant.

5	Pathogenic	Oct 31, 2022	The FOXRED1 c.694C>T variant is predicted to result in premature protein termination (p.Gln232*). This variant was reported in individuals with mitochondrial complex I deficiency (Calvo et al. 2010. PubMed ID: 20818383, supplementary data; Formosa et al. 2015. PubMed ID: 25678554; Apatean et al. 2019. PubMed ID: 30723688). This variant is reported in 0.0040% of alleles in individuals of African descent in gnomAD (http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/variant/11-126145284-C-T). Nonsense variants in FOXRED1 are expected to be pathogenic. This variant is interpreted as pathogenic.

5	Pathogenic	Dec 01, 2023	This sequence change creates a premature translational stop signal (p.Gln232*) in the FOXRED1 gene. It is expected to result in an absent or disrupted protein product. Loss-of-function variants in FOXRED1 are known to be pathogenic (PMID: 20818383, 20858599). This variant is present in population databases (rs267606829, gnomAD 0.003%). This premature translational stop signal has been observed in individual(s) with Leigh syndrome (PMID: 20818383). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 5). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

9	Pathogenic	Sep 03, 2024	The HFE c.845G>A variant is predicted to result in the amino acid substitution p.Cys282Tyr. In patients with transferrin-iron saturation higher than 45%, presence of the c.845G>A (p.Cys282Tyr) variant is useful in confirmation of hereditary hemochromatosis diagnosis as individuals homozygous for the variant represent 80% of cases (Bacon et al. 2011. PubMed ID: 21452290; Alexander and Kowdley. 2009. PubMed ID: 19444013; Kowdley et al. 2012. PubMed ID: 22395570). The c.845G>A (p.Cys282Tyr) variant is incompletely penetrant with ~35% of individuals homozygous for the variant having normal ferritin levels (Bacon et al. 2011. PubMed ID: 21452290). This variant is interpreted as pathogenic.

9	Pathogenic	Sep 12, 2023	The HFE c.845G>A (p.Cys282Tyr) variant has been reported in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state in many individuals affected with hereditary hemochromatosis and is considered the most common cause of hereditary hemochromatosis (Barton JC and Edwards CQ, PMID: 20301613). Studies show penetrance rates of severe iron overload to be as high as 35% and severe liver disease in 9–24% among male p.Cys282Tyr homozygotes (Grosse SD et al., PMID: 28771247). This variant has been reported in the ClinVar database as a germline pathogenic variant by many submitters. Computational predictors indicate that the variant is damaging, evidence that correlates with impact to HFE function. In support of these predictions, a homozygous mouse model showed postnatal iron loading and in vitro functional studies have shown that the variant causes reduced function (Ali-Rahmani F et al., PMID: 21243428; Boucherma R et al., PMID: 22531912; Levy JE et al., PMID: 10381492). Based on available information and the ACMG/AMP guidelines for variant interpretation (Richards S et al., PMID: 25741868), this variant is classified as pathogenic with reduced penetrance.

9	Pathogenic	Jul 21, 2023	The variant NM_000410.4:c.845G>A (chr6:26092913) in HFE was detected in 7331 heterozygotes and 264 homozygotes out of 58K WGS Icelanders (MAF= 6,775%). Following imputation in a set of 166K Icelanders (710 imputed homozygotes) we observed an association with hemochromatosis under a recessive model using 2403 cases and 240747 controls (OR= 50.27, P= 2.69e-212). This variant has been reported multiple times in ClinVar as pathogenic. Based on ACMG criteria (PS3, PS4, PP1, PP4, PP5) this variant classifies as pathogenic.

9	Pathogenic	Jun 01, 2021	• The p.Cys282Tyr variant in the HFE gene has been identified in the homozygous state in approximately 60- 90% of individuals of European ancestry with HFE hemochromatosis, and in the compound heterozygous state with p.His63Asp in approximately 3-8% of individuals of European ancestry with HFE hemochromatosis (Barton and Edwards, 2018). • The p.Cys282Tyr variant is associated with a high penetrance for biochemical evidence of iron overload, but with a low penetrance for clinical manifestations of iron overload with studies reporting evidence of clinical disease present in as low as 2% and as high as 33% of p.Cys282Tyr homozygotes (Beutler et al., 2002; Whitlock et al., 2006). • Individuals heterozygous for the p.Cys282Tyr variant may demonstrate evidence of biochemical disease, including mildly elevated serum transferrin-iron saturation and serum ferritin concentration, but do not develop clinical manifestations of disease (Allen et al., 2008; Pedersen and Milman, 2009). • This variant has been identified in 7,435/128,950 European (non-Finnish) chromosomes (9,544/282,608 chromosomes overall) by the Genome Aggregation Database (http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/). Although the p.Cys282Tyr variant is seen at a frequency greater than 5% in the general population, this variant is recognized as a common low-penetrant variant that is an exception to ACMG/AMP classification guidelines (Ghosh et al., 2018). • These data were assessed using the ACMG/AMP variant interpretation guidelines. In summary, there is sufficient evidence to classify the p.Cys282Tyr variant as pathogenic for autosomal recessive HFE hemochromatosis based on the information above.

9	Pathogenic	Mar 30, 2016	The c.845G>A (p.Cys282Tyr) missense variant is widely recognized as one of the two most common disease-causing variants in the HFE gene. Cys282Tyr homozygotes account for 80-85% of typical patients with Hereditary Hemochromatosis (HH). However, the majority of individuals who are homozygous for this variant do not develop the disease (GeneReviews, Kowdley et al., 2012; Ramrakhiani and Bacon, 1998; and Morrison et al., 2003). In summary, this variant c.845G>A (p.Cys282Tyr) meets our criteria for a Pathogenic classification. We have confirmed this finding in our laboratory using Sanger sequencing.

9	Pathogenic	Feb 02, 2022	The HFE c.845G>A (p.Cys282Tyr) missense variant results in the substitution of cysteine at amino acid position 282 to tyrosine. This variant is one of the two most common and well-studied pathogenic variants associated with HFE hemochromatosis. Approximately 60-90% of individuals of European ancestry with HFE hemochromatosis are homozygous for the variant and between 3-8% of individuals are compound heterozygous (Feder et al. 1996; Morrison et al. 2003; Gallego et al. 2015; Press et al. 2016; Barton and Edwards 2018). Disease penetrance for c.845G>A variant carriers is variable (Beutler et al. 2002; Pedersen et al. 2009; Gurrin et al. 2009), with homozygotes being at a greater risk for iron overload than compound heterozygotes (Gallego et al. 2015; Barton and Edwards 2018). The c.845G>A variant affects HFE protein activity by preventing the formation of a disulfide bridge in the alpha-3 domain, which impairs the beta-2-microglobulin interaction and prevents the protein from reaching the cell surface (Feder et al. 1997; Barton and Edwards 2018). The c.845G>A variant has a frequency of 5-7% in Caucasians (Press et al. 2016) and is reported at a frequency of 0.064660 in the European (non-Finnish) population (including 137 homozygotes) of the Genome Aggregation Database (version 3.1.2). This allele frequency is high but is consistent with estimates of disease prevalence. Based on the available evidence, the c.845G>A (p.Cys282Tyr) variant is classified as pathogenic for HFE hemochromatosis but is noted to have reduced penetrance.

9	Pathogenic	Jun 05, 2017	The c.845G>A (p.Cys282Tyr) variant in the HFE gene in the homozygous state has been reported as a common cause of hereditary hemochromatosis with high penetrance of biochemically defined iron overload but low penetrance of clinically defined iron overload [OMIM:613609.0001; PMID 8896549, 10381492, 18199861]. This variant has been detected at high frequency in the ExAC population database (up to 5% in Europeans) (http://exac.broadinstitute.org/variant/6-26093141-G-A). Cysteine at amino acid position 282 of the HFE protein is highly conserved in mammals and computer-based algorithms predict this p.Cys282Tyr change to be deleterious. This variant is classified as pathogenic.<BR>Apparent homozygosity of this variant may be caused by the presence of the mutant allele on both alleles of this individual, or the presence of a mutant allele on one allele and an exonic deletion on the opposite allele. Copy number variant (CNV) analysis or segregation analysis is necessary to assess the apparent homozygosity status of this variant.

9	Pathogenic, low penetrance	Jan 31, 2024	This sequence change replaces cysteine, which is neutral and slightly polar, with tyrosine, which is neutral and polar, at codon 282 of the HFE protein (p.Cys282Tyr). This variant is present in population databases (rs1800562, gnomAD 6%), and has an allele count higher than expected for a pathogenic variant. This is a common, low penetrance variant that is known to contribute to hemochromatosis when homozygous or present with a second pathogenic allele in HFE. As many as 90% of individuals of European descent who are affected with hemochromatosis are homozygous for this variant (PMID: 16132052, 26153218, 26365338). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 9). Advanced modeling of protein sequence and biophysical properties (such as structural, functional, and spatial information, amino acid conservation, physicochemical variation, residue mobility, and thermodynamic stability) performed at Invitae indicates that this missense variant is expected to disrupt HFE protein function with a positive predictive value of 80%. Experimental studies have shown that this missense change disrupts a disulfide bond in the Œ±3 domain of the HFE protein and impairs interaction of HFE with beta2-microglobulin, resulting in a block in intracellular transport and loss of cell surface expression of the Cys282Tyr variant protein (PMID: 9162021, 9356458). In summary, this variant is reported to cause disease. However, as this variant is associated with a lower penetrance than other pathogenic alleles in the HFE gene, it has been classified as Pathogenic (low penetrance).

9	risk factor	Mar 04, 2020	HFE c.845G>A (p.Cys282Tyr) has been associated with increased risk for hemochromatosis. This variant has been observed in multiple ethnic backgrounds with highest frequencies in individuals of European ancestry (5.7%, Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD); rs1800562) and is present in ClinVar (ID: 9). A large meta-analysis has reported an odds ratio of 1.2 [95% CI 0.8-1.6] for developing liver disease in heterozygous carriers (Ellervik 2007). In vitro and in vivo functional studies provide some evidence that this variant may impact protein function (Ali-Rahmani 2011, Boucherma 2012). In summary, this variant is uncertain risk allele for hemochromatosis in heterozygous state. HFE c.845G>A (p.Cys282Tyr) has been associated with increased risk for hemochromatosis. This variant has been observed in multiple ethnic backgrounds with highest frequencies in individuals of European ancestry (5.7%, Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD); rs1800562) and is present in ClinVar (ID: 9). A large meta-analysis has reported an odds ratio of 3.9 [95% CI 1.9-8.1] for developing liver disease in homozygous carriers (Ellervik 2007). In vitro and in vivo functional studies provide some evidence that this variant may impact protein function (Ali-Rahmani 2011, Boucherma 2012). In summary, this variant is established risk allele for hemochromatosis in homozygous state.

9	Pathogenic	Feb 23, 2021	Variant summary: HFE c.845G>A (p.Cys282Tyr) results in a non-conservative amino acid change located in the Immunoglobulin C1-set domain (IPR003597) of the encoded protein sequence. Five of five in-silico tools predict a damaging effect of the variant on protein function. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 0.033 in 251236 control chromosomes in the gnomAD database, including 244 homozygotes. c.845G>A has been reported in the literature as the most common mutation found in individuals with Hemochromatosis Type 1, being identified as homozygous or compound heterozygous with another pathogenic variant in approximately 80-90% of reported cases, most frequently in individuals of European ancestry (e.g. Feder_1996, LeGac_2004, Beutler_2002, Yonal_2007, vanGemmeren_2015, deTayrac_2015, Zhang_2020). These data indicate that the variant is likely to be associated with disease, however the variant appears to have significantly reduced penetrance, as the majority of homozygous or compound heterozygous individuals with this variant do not exhibit clinical symptoms of the disorder despite some cases having elevated serum ferritin and transferrin saturation levels (e.g. Feder_1996, Beutler_2002, Yonal_2007). The mechanisms behind the variable expressivity of this variant are not known, but it has been proposed that other genetic variants could modify the phenotype exhibited by individuals who are homozygous for this variant (e.g. LeGac_2004, deTayrac_2015). In-vitro experimental evidence suggests that the Cys282Tyr-mutant protein has impaired intracellular trafficking and accelerated degradation compared to wild-type HFE (e.g. Waheed_1997) and that cells expressing the variant have altered expression of genes involved in sphingolipid metabolism (e.g. Ali-Rahmani_2011). In addition, an in-vivo study reported a loss of CD8+ T-cell tolerance to HFE in transgenic mice expressing the C282Y variant (e.g. Boucherma_2012) . Seventeen clinical diagnostic laboratories have submitted clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014 without evidence for independent evaluation. Sixteen of these laboratories cited the variant as pathogenic/likely pathogenic or as a risk factor for disease. Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as pathogenic with low penetrance for developing Hemochromatosis.

9	Pathogenic	Sep 27, 2021	The c.845G>A (p.C282Y) alteration is located in coding exon 4 of the HFE gene. This alteration results from a G to A substitution at nucleotide position 845, causing the cysteine (C) at amino acid position 282 to be replaced by a tyrosine (Y). Based on data from gnomAD, the A allele has an overall frequency of 3.38% (9544/282608) total alleles studied. The highest observed frequency was 5.77% (7435/128950) of European (non-Finnish) alleles. This alteration is the most common cause of hereditary hemochromatosis (Allen, 2008). In homozygous individuals, up to 50% may develop iron overload, with 10-33% developing hemochromatosis-associated morbidity (EASL, 2010). Men appear to have a higher risk for disease development than women. In homozygous men, 84% display elevated transferrin-iron saturation and 88% have elevated serum ferritin concentration. In comparison, fewer homozygous women have elevated transferrin-iron saturation and serum ferritin concentration (73% and 57%, respectively). However, when p.C282Y is compound heterozygous with another pathogenic alteration, disease penetrance is significantly lower (Adams, 1997). This amino acid position is highly conserved in available vertebrate species. Functional studies have shown that this alteration leads to impaired intracellular transport of the protein and degradation before reaching the cell surface (Feder, 1997; Waheed, 1997). This alteration is predicted to be deleterious by in silico analysis. Based on the available evidence, this alteration is classified as pathogenic.

9	Pathogenic	-	The HFE p.Cys282Tyr variant is a common variant known to cause hereditary hemochromatosis; over 80% of hereditary hemochromatosis patients are homozygous for the p.C282Y variant (Feder_1996_PMID:8696333; Morrison_2003_PMID:12693884). The variant was identified in dbSNP (ID: rs1800562), in ClinVar (classified as pathogenic 13 times, likely pathogenic once and as a VUS once) and LOVD 3.0 (classified as pathogenic). The variant was identified in control databases in 9544 of 282608 chromosomes (276 homozygous) at a frequency of 0.033771 increasing the likelihood this could be a low frequency benign variant (Genome Aggregation Database Feb 27, 2017). The variant was observed in the following populations: European (non-Finnish) in 7435 of 128950 chromosomes (freq: 0.05766), Other in 281 of 7224 chromosomes (freq: 0.0389), European (Finnish) in 879 of 25108 chromosomes (freq: 0.03501), Latino in 494 of 35430 chromosomes (freq: 0.01394), Ashkenazi Jewish in 124 of 10366 chromosomes (freq: 0.01196), African in 260 of 24962 chromosomes (freq: 0.01042), South Asian in 68 of 30616 chromosomes (freq: 0.002221), and East Asian in 3 of 19952 chromosomes (freq: 0.00015). The p.Cys282 residue is conserved across mammals and other organisms, and four out of five computational analyses (PolyPhen-2, SIFT, AlignGVGD, BLOSUM, MutationTaster) suggest that the variant may impact the protein. Functional studies of the p.C282Y variant have demonstrated abnormal protein interaction, expression, processing and localization (Feder_1997_PMID:9162021; Waheed_1997_PMID:9356458). In summary, based on the above information this variant meets our laboratoryâ€šÃ„Ã´s criteria to be classified as pathogenic.	not provided	C3661900:not provided	no assertion criteria provided	clinical testing	unknown:na	Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Sinai Health System	SCV001549492.1	HFE	-	-	-
9	Pathogenic	Nov 05, 2023	This sequence change in HFE is predicted to replace cysteine with tyrosine at codon 282, p.(Cys282Tyr). The cysteine residue is highly conserved (100 vertebrates, UCSC), and alters a critical cysteine residue involved in a disulfide bond in the Ig-like C2 type domain and prevents HFE protein presentation (PMID: 20301613). There is a large physicochemical difference between cysteine and tyrosine. The highest population minor allele frequency in the population database gnomAD v2.1 is 5.6% (7,345/128,950 alleles, 243 homozygotes) in the European non-Finnish population. This variant is reported as the common cause of HFE-related haemochromatosis. It has been reported in multiple individuals with haemochromatosis who were either homozygous or compound heterozygous for the variant (PMID: 19159930, 32153640, 11903354). The variant has been reported to segregate with haemochromatosis in multiple affected individuals from unrelated families (PMID: 10575540, 27518069). In vitro functional assays with limited validation showed a significant impairment to protein trafficking and accelerated protein degradation indicating that this variant impacts protein function (PMID: 9162021, 9356458). A transgenic mouse model for the variant showed an increased predisposition to iron loading (PMID: 10381492). Computational evidence predicts a deleterious effect for the missense substitution (REVEL = 0.872). Based on the classification scheme RMH Modified ACMG/AMP Guidelines v1.6.1, this variant is classified as PATHOGENIC.

9	Pathogenic	May 20, 2023	The missense variant c.845G>A(p.Cys282Tyr) in HFE gene has been reported in homozygous state in multiple individuals affected with hemochromatosis (Porto G et. al., 2016; Gallego et. al., 2015). Experimental studies have shown that this missense change disrupts a disulfide bond in the Œ±3 domain of the HFE protein and impairs interaction of HFE with beta2-microglobulin, resulting in a block in intracellular transport and loss of cell surface expression of the Cys282Tyr variant protein (Waheed et. al., 1997). The observed variant has allele frequency of 3.3% in gnomAD exomes database. This variant has been submitted to the ClinVar database as risk factor / Uncertain Significance / Pathogenic (multiple submissions). The reference amino acid change p.Cys282Tyr in HFE is predicted as conserved by GERP++ and PhyloP across 100 vertebrates. The amino acid Cys at position 282 is changed to a Tyr changing protein sequence and it might alter its composition and physico-chemical properties. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.

9	Pathogenic	Mar 30, 2021	HFE NM_000410.3 exon 4 p.Cys282Tyr (c.845G>A): This variant has been reported in the literature in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state in many individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) (Allen 2008 PMID:18199861, Pederson 2009 PMID:19159930, Cezard 2014 PMID:23953397, Gallego 2015 PMID:26365338) and is reported to be the most common cause of HH (Le Gac 2005 PMID:16132052, Gallego 2015 PMID:26365338, Porto 2016 PMID:26153218). This variant is present in 3.3% (9544/282608) of total alleles in the Genome Aggregation Database, including 276 homozygotes (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/variant/6-26093141-G-A). Please note, disease causing variants may be present in control databases at low frequencies, reflective of the general population, carrier status, and/or variable expressivity. This variant is present in ClinVar, with several labs classifying this variant as pathogenic (Variation ID:9). Evolutionary conservation and computational predictive tools suggest that this variant may impact the protein. In addition, an in vivo mouse study showed postnatal iron loading in mice homozygous for this variant (Levy 1999 PMID:10381492), and in vitro functional studies have shown that the mutant protein is retained in the ER and is unable to interact with beta2-microglobulin (Feder 1997 PMID:9162021, Waheed 1997 PMID:9356458). However, these studies may not accurately represent in vivo biological function. In summary, this variant is classified as pathogenic based on the data above.

10	Pathogenic	-	The HFE c.187C>G (p.H63D) variant is a pathogenic variant seen in 10.8% of the human population in gnomAD. Indviduals with the p.H63D variant are considered carriers of hemochromatosis, although this variant is associated with less severe iron overload and reduced penetrance compared to another pathogenic HFE variant, c.845G>A, p.C282Y (PMID: 19159930; 20301613).

10	Pathogenic	May 13, 2021	• The p.His63Asp variant in the HFE gene has been identified in the homozygous state in approximately 1% of individuals of European ancestry with HFE hemochromatosis, and in the compound heterozygous state with p.Cys282Tyr in approximately 3-8% of individuals of European ancestry with HFE hemochromatosis (Barton and Edwards, 2018). • The p.His63Asp variant is described as a low-penetrant allele and is rarely associated with clinical disease in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state (Gochee et al., 2002; Gurrin et al., 2009). • Individuals heterozygous for the p.His63Asp variant may demonstrate evidence of biochemical disease, including mildly elevated serum transferrin-iron saturation and serum ferritin concentration, but do not develop clinical manifestations of disease (Allen et al., 2008; Pedersen and Milman, 2009). • This variant has been identified in 18,635/129,168 European (non-Finnish) chromosomes (30,592/282,844 chromosomes overall) by the Genome Aggregation Database (http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/). Although the p.His63Asp variant is seen at a frequency greater than 5% in the general population, this variant is recognized as a common low-penetrant variant that is an exception to ACMG/AMP classification guidelines (Ghosh et al., 2018). • These data were assessed using the ACMG/AMP variant interpretation guidelines. In summary, there is sufficient evidence to classify the p.His63Asp variant as pathogenic for autosomal recessive HFE hemochromatosis based on the information above.

10	Pathogenic	-	The observed missense c.187C>G(p.His63Asp) variant in HFE gene has been reported previously in homozygous or compound heterozygous state in multiple individuals affected with hemochromatosis (Atkins et al., 2022), however, penetrance of the homozygous genotype is very low and is associated with variable phenotypes. Experimental studies have shown that this missense change affects HFE function (Tomatsu et al., 2003). This variant has been reported with the high allele frequency of 10.9% in the gnomAD Exomes. This variant has been submitted to the ClinVar database with Benign / Uncertain Significance / Risk factor / Pathogenic (multiple submitters). The amino acid His at position 63 is changed to a Asp changing protein sequence and it might alter its composition and physico-chemical properties. The amino acid change p.His63Asp in HFE is predicted as conserved by GERP++ and PhyloP across 100 vertebrates.Though the variant frequency is very high in the population, the variant is enriched in patints with HFE hemochromatosis as compared to the general population (Burke et al., 2000). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as a Pathogenic variant which acts as a risk factor for the development of the disease.

10	Pathogenic	Feb 26, 2021	Variant summary: HFE c.187C>G (p.His63Asp) results in a non-conservative amino acid change located in the MHC class I-like antigen recognition-like domain (IPR011161) of the encoded protein sequence. Three of five in-silico tools predict a benign effect of the variant on protein function. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 0.11 in 251484 control chromosomes in the gnomAD database, including 1832 homozygotes. c.187C>G has been reported as a common disease variant in the literature in individuals affected with Hemochromatosis Type 1, in both homozygous and compound heterozygous states, but most frequently in trans with the most common disease variant c.845G>A (p.Cys282Tyr) (e.g. Feder_1996, Kelley_2014). These data indicate that the variant is likely to be associated with disease, however the variant appears to have very low penetrance, as the majority of homozygous or compound heterozygous individuals with this variant do not exhibit clinical symptoms of hemochromatosis despite some cases having elevated serum ferritin and transferrin saturation levels (e.g. Beutler_2002, Pedersen_2009). Several publications report experimental evidence evaluating an impact on protein function. While p.His63Asp was shown to have normal levels of association with beta2-globulin and expression of HFE on the cell surface in contrast to impairment observed in cells with the other common pathogenic variant p.Cys282Tyr (e.g. Waheed_1997), p.His63Asp was shown to induce ER-stress in-vitro and in a transgenic mouse model (e.g. Liu_2011). Transgenic mice expressing the murine equivalent of this variant were also reported to have increased iron storage and decreased levels of iron mobilization at 12 months of age (e.g. Nandar_2013). The variant has also been reported to alter the expression levels of several genes involved in sphingolipid metabolism (e.g. Ali-Rahmani_2011) and to affect cellular glutamate levels (e.g. Mitchell_2011). Sixteen clinical diagnostic laboratories have submitted clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014 without evidence for independent evaluation. Thirteen of these submitters report the variant as either Pathogenic or a risk factor for disease. Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as pathogenic with very low penetrance in association with Hemochromatosis.
